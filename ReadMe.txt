CodeRedeemer
====================

Information
------------
This custom library can be used to redeem a custom promo code inside your app to unlock items, access hidden areas, etc. Essentially, you must have a UITextField in which the user enters the promo code. Then, CodeRedeemer checks it against a specified URL of a .txt file containing the promo code. CodeRedeemer will automatically save a copy of the most recently validated code to NSUserDefaults so you can reference it later (if, for instance, you wanted to make sure the user canâ€™t use the same code twice, or if you wanted to see which promo code was used). The example project shows this in action.

CodeRedeemer uses ARC.

Usage
-----
1. Add the .h and .m files to your project
2. Import the library
	#import "CodeRedeemer.h"
3. Allocate CodeRedeemer
	CodeRedeemer *cRedeemer = [CodeRedeemer alloc];
4. Call the "submitCode:" method
	[cRedeemer submitCode:/*fill in method here*/];
5. CodeRedeemer will send a success or failure callback to the view controller that sent the request.
